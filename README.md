## YouTube-Data-Analytics
The aim of this project was to help a client in a Data driven marketing campaign on YouTube. Ingested Data incrementally, designed a Data Lake on AWS S3, a scalable ETL pipeline using AWS Spark, used Athena and SQL to analyze the data and finally built BI Dashboards on QuickSight to represent and translate the insights. Factors affecting a popular video and categorization of videos based on comments and statistics could be answered before investing money in this campaign.
